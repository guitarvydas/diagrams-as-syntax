The code in this directory embellishes fb.pl (starting with out.pl) with
semantically more-interesting facts.

See ./run.bash.


"out.pl" must be generated and copy/pasted from ../phase1/daswb.html.

../phase1/das2b.html uses JS .sort() to produce output (which you manually copy/paste into out.pl).
